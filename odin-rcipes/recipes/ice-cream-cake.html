      <em>An ice cream cake</em> is a cake made entirely out of ice cream. A simpler no-bake<br>
      version can be made by layering different flavors of ice cream in a loaf pan.<br>
      Ice cream cake is a popular party food, often eaten at birthdays and weddings,<br>
      particularly in <i>North America</i> and <i>Australia</i>. It is not as well known in <i>Europe</i>.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li><small>1/3</small> cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li><small>1/2</small> gallon chocolate ice cream</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="I" start="1">
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
      <li>Combine chocolate cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth,<br>
        about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 26 to 30 minutes.<br>
        Allow to cool completely on a wired rack.</li>
      <li value="4">Meanwhile, remove the carton paper from ice cream. Set ice cream block on its long side. Use a piece of string or<br>
        dental floss to cut ice cream in half lengthwise, then place the 2 pieces side-by-side on a sheet of waxed paper.</li>
      <li>Remove cooled cake from the baking dish and place over the ice cream slabs. Trim cake and ice cream, so the edges are flush.</li>
      <li>Place a board or serving platter over cake. Holding onto the waxed paper and board,<br>
        flip ice cream cake over. Remove the waxed paper and smooth the seam between the ice cream slabs.</li>
      <li>Cover top with waxed paper and freeze until very firm. Decorate as desired.</li>
