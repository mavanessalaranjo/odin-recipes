    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <em>The grilled cheese sandwich</em> is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by heating slices of<br>
      cheese between slices of bread with a cooking fat such as butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan,<br>
      griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts.
